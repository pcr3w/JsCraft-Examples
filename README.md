# JsCraft-Examples
Here you can find several example mods for JsCraft - my own Javascript modding API for Minecraft. Feel free to play around with the code to see how everything works.

##Redstone Striker
This mod (inspired by the forum post [here](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-discussion/suggestions/2694709-redstone-striker-handheld-power-source)) adds a single item to Minecraft - the redstone striker. It allows users to activate redstone devices temporarily by right clicking on them.

##Turtle Plugin
This mod adds a turtle plugin that is available to other mods under the ID `pcr3w.Turtle`. It is very basic and can only draw straight lines.

##Useful Crafting
This mod adds several new crafting recipes to Minecraft that make playing a little bit easier. One of the recipes, for example, allows leather to be crafted from smelting rotten flesh.
